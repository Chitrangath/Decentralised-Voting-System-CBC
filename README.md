# Decentralized Voting System

A blockchain-based voting system built on Ethereum that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections.

## How It Works

This system uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to manage the entire voting process:

1. **Voter Registration**: Users register with their Aadhaar number and Voter ID
2. **Candidate Registration**: Registered voters can register as candidates
3. **Voting**: Registered voters can vote for candidates (one vote per person)
4. **Results**: Real-time vote counting and winner determination

All data is stored on the blockchain, making it immutable and transparent.

## Prerequisites

- **MetaMask**: Install the MetaMask browser extension
- **Ethereum**: Have some ETH for transaction fees
- **IPFS**: Access to upload candidate images (optional)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-voting-system.git
cd decentralized-voting-system
```

### 2. Deploy Smart Contract (If needed)
- Deploy `DecentralizedVotingSystem.sol` to Ethereum network
- Update contract address in `script.js` if you deploy your own contract

### 3. Setup Frontend
- No build process required - pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Simply open `index.html` in your browser
- Or serve it using any web server

## Setup

1. **Install MetaMask** and create/import an Ethereum wallet
2. **Connect to Network**: Switch to the network where the contract is deployed
3. **Open Website**: Load the `index.html` file in your browser
4. **Connect Wallet**: Click connect when MetaMask prompts

## How to Use

### Step 1: Register as Voter

Before you can vote or become a candidate, you must register:

1. Click the **"Login"** button
2. Fill in your details:
   - **Aadhaar Number**: 12-digit number
   - **Voter ID**: 10-character ID
   - **Age**: Must be 18 or above
3. Click **"Register"** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask

### Step 2: Register as Candidate (Optional)

If you want to run for election:

1. Click **"Register as Candidate"**
2. Fill in your details:
   - **Full Name**
   - **Age**: Must match your voter registration age
   - **Candidate ID**: Unique number
   - **Image CID**: Upload your photo to IPFS and enter the CID
3. Click **"Register"** and confirm the transaction

### Step 3: Vote

1. Browse the list of candidates on the main page
2. Click the **"Vote"** button for your preferred candidate
3. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed

### Step 4: View Results

- **Current Vote Count**: Click "View Vote Count" to see how many votes each candidate has
- **Election Winner**: Click "View Results" to see who is currently winning

## Important Rules

- You must be 18 or older to participate
- Each person can only register once (using unique Aadhaar/Voter ID)
- Each registered voter can vote only once
- Only registered voters can become candidates
- All transactions require gas fees (ETH)

## Technical Details

- **Smart Contract**: Written in Solidity ^0.8.0
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Web3.js
- **Storage**: Candidate images stored on IPFS
- **Network**: Ethereum blockchain

## Contract Address

The smart contract is deployed at: `0x6F4Ed69DCFc56e9966d3b0C3711B53c434c47dD9`

## Troubleshooting

**"Please install MetaMask"**: Install the MetaMask browser extension

**Transaction Failed**: 
- Check if you have enough ETH for gas fees
- Make sure you're connected to the correct network
- Verify your input data is correct

**"You must register"**: Complete voter registration first before voting or registering as candidate

**"Already registered"**: You can only register once with each Aadhaar/Voter ID

## Security Features

- **Blockchain Verification**: All votes are recorded on the blockchain
- **Identity Verification**: Prevents duplicate registrations
- **One Vote Rule**: Smart contract prevents multiple votes from same address
- **Transparency**: All votes are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
